## About

**Why is it even exists when there are a lot of other solutions (better perfomance, better logic, better overall and etc.)?**

It is simple as that:

**What is this good for?**

You can use this library to track vehicles / peoples and etc. when you don't need that much accuracy or ReID.

**Are more advanced algorithms considered to be implemented in futher?**

Yes, I do think so. I guess that [SORT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00763) will be the next one.
